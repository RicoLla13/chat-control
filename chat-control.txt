Dear Representatives,

I am writing to express my serious concerns about the proposed Chat Control legislation (CSAM Regulation) currently being reconsidered under the Danish EU Council Presidency.

I am particularly concerned about the following issues:

• The proposed Chat Control legislation represents an unprecedented violation of our fundamental right to privacy. Mass surveillance of private communications is incompatible with Article 7 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

• Breaking end-to-end encryption would make all EU citizens vulnerable to cybercriminals, authoritarian regimes, and foreign interference. Strong encryption is essential for our digital security and economic competitiveness.

• Technical experts and child protection organisations have pointed out that this approach will not effectively protect children while creating massive privacy violations. We need targeted, evidence-based solutions instead.

• This proposal has been repeatedly rejected or stalled by democratic institutions, with the European Parliament voting against mass surveillance and the Council failing to achieve majority support for over two years.

• AI-based content scanning produces numerous false positives, potentially criminalizing innocent family photos and conversations. The technical implementation is fundamentally flawed and unreliable.

I urge you to:
• Vote against any proposal that mandates mass surveillance of private communications
• Protect end-to-end encryption and digital privacy rights
• Support targeted, evidence-based approaches to child protection
• Ensure proper democratic scrutiny of this legislation
• Reject the European Parliament's conditioning the extension of the temporary derogation (with voluntary scanning arrangements) on Council advancing the mandatory chat control proposal
• Ask your group whether they require an agreement on the proposed mandatory bulk scanning as a precondition of extending the current voluntary regime (interim regulation)

The current proposal fails to balance child protection with fundamental rights and would set a dangerous precedent for digital surveillance in the EU.

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely,
Liviu Arsenescu, a romanian citizen.
